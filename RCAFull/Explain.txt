Ripple Carry Adder (RCA):performs addition of two 𝑛-bit numbers. 
the project i attached performs the addition in two stages as follows:
1- In the first stage, we need to reduce the problem of adding three numbers into 
adding two 𝑛-bit numbers. The 8-bits of S and C will be computed at the same time.

2- In the second stage, RCA is used to compute the summation and the carry.

also i attached Test Bench code and screenshots:
For simplicity, the Test bench was conducted using three different tuples only

(T1=(X= 1100, Y= 1101, Z=1110),
 T2=(X= 1111, Y= 1000, Z=1001),
 T3=(X= 1110, Y= 0101, Z= 0111))
